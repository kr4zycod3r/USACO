Here,I will add the questions in USACO training pages as and when I solve them.

* Some solutions do not have proper commenting as I started out as a newbie and trying to improve constantly.Didn't understand the 
importance of clean code and comments.So bear with me! (: 

* Anybody who wants to give alternate better solutions than mine is most welcome

* The solutions have passed all the test cases of USACO 

* Any test cases that seem to not pass are welcome

* You can submit your solution to me at: piyushgoel28@gmail.com

* Or you can give me suggestions about improving my code/coding style.

*Thanks!
